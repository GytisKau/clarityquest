          "feedback_incorrect": "In a post-truth society, people often rely on emotionally charged narratives and confirmation bias rather than critically evaluating evidence from credible sources. Social media amplifies misinformation and echo chambers, which reinforce personal beliefs and reduce exposure to diverse perspectives. The post-truth era is characterized by the erosion of trust in traditional media and expert knowledge, leading to a diminished emphasis on critical thinking and factual accuracy.",
          "feedback_correct": "The dominance of emotional and personal beliefs over objective facts is a key characteristic of the post-truth era because it underscores the fundamental shift in how people process information and form opinions. In this era, individuals are more likely to prioritize their feelings, identities, and preconceived notions over evidence and rational argumentation. This phenomenon is driven by factors such as the proliferation of misinformation on social media, the decline of trust in traditional media and experts, and the tendency to seek out information that confirms existing biases."

This shift is often fueled by the widespread dissemination of misinformation and the echo chambers created by social media, where people are exposed primarily to information that reinforces their preexisting views. Consequently, emotional appeals resonate more powerfully, as they align with individuals' identities and biases, making it difficult for objective facts to penetrate and alter deeply held convictions."

Misinformation and emotionally charged content spread rapidly online, reaching a wide audience quickly. Additionally, there is a growing distrust in traditional authorities and experts, fueled by political polarization and skepticism about institutional integrity. Furthermore, cognitive biases lead individuals to favor information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs, regardless of its source. ",
          "feedback_correct": "Emotional and sensationalist media content significantly impacts public opinion because it captures attention and evokes strong reactions more effectively than factual reporting. This type of content often simplifies complex issues into compelling stories that are easy to understand and share, appealing to people's emotions and biases. Sensationalism leverages fear, anger, and excitement, which are powerful drivers of engagement and memory retention. In the digital age, where media consumption is rapid and fragmented, content that elicits strong emotional responses is more likely to be amplified and influence public opinion, overshadowing nuanced and fact-based information."
